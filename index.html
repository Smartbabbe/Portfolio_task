              My name is Esther Israel. I am a passionate web developer, known for delivering classy
              websites. I pride in my skills and ability to deliver exactly what
              clients want and as at when due. A website never goes wrong with
              me as the front-end developer. I work closely with UI/Ux designers
              and back-end developers to make a website come to live.

            <p>
              I am always eager to learn new things. I have worked on a few
              projects personally and in a team, my github profile can attest to
              that. I love taking up challenges because it forces me out of my
              comfort zone and makes me better at my skills. I finished a
              full-stack web developer course by zuri and I'm currently
              undergoing front-end web developement course on Stutern. I am also
              a virtual assistant and a crypto trader.
